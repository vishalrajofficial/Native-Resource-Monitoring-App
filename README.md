**Native Resource Monitoring Web App**

The Native Resource Monitoring Web App is a containerized web application designed to provide real-time monitoring and analysis of various system resources on a user's device. It allows users to track their device's performance, including CPU, memory, battery, and network usage. The app is built using native web technologies to ensure efficient performance and a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: The app provides real-time monitoring of CPU usage, memory consumption, battery level, and network activity on the user's device.

- **Graphical Representation**: Users can visualize resource usage data through interactive graphs, making it easier to interpret trends and patterns.

- **Resource Alerts**: Set custom resource usage thresholds and receive alerts when any of the resources exceed the defined limits.

- **History and Trends**: The app keeps track of historical resource usage data, allowing users to analyze trends over time.

- **User-friendly Interface**: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
